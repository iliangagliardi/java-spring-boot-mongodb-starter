# Quick Start Java & MongoDB Project

## Supported versions:

- Java 18
- Spring boot 2.5.7
- MongoDB v4.2.21
- MongoDB Java driver 4.6.1
- Maven 3.8.6
- Swagger 3.0.0


- Start the server in a console with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
- If you add some Unit Tests, you would start them with `mvn clean test`.
- You can start the end to end tests with `mvn clean integration-test`.
- You can build the project with : `mvn clean package`.
- You can run the project with the fat jar and the embedded Tomcat: `java -jar target/java-spring-boot-mongodb-starter-1.0.0.jar` but I would use a real tomcat in production.
